\title{Calculate Outliers Summary by Year}
\usage{
calculate_outliers_summary(
  .data,
  admin_level = c("national", "adminlevel_1", "district"),
  include_year = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame with district-level health indicators. This data
frame must include a \code{district} and \code{year} column, along with indicator columns
for calculating outliers. Outlier flags should be computed prior and named
with the suffix \verb{_outlier5std} (e.g., \code{anc1_outlier5std} where 1 indicates an
outlier and 0 indicates non-outliers).}

\item{admin_level}{Character. The administrative level at which to calculate
reporting rates. Must be one of \code{"national"}, \code{"adminlevel_1"} or \code{"district"}.}

\item{include_year}{Integer. Whether to include the year}
}
\value{
A \code{cd_outliers_summary} object (tibble) with:
\itemize{
\item Each indicator's non-outlier percentage (\verb{_outlier5std} columns).
\item Overall non-outlier summaries across all indicators, vaccination indicators, and tracers.
}
}
\description{
\code{calculate_outliers_summary} provides an annual overview of data quality by
summarizing extreme outliers for health indicators. Outliers are identified
based on robust statistical metrics (Median Absolute Deviation, MAD) and
flagged when they deviate significantly (beyond five MADs from the median).
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Outlier Detection}: Outliers are calculated based on Hampelâ€™s robust X84
method, using the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). This method identifies values
that exceed five times the MAD from the median, reducing the influence of extreme
values on the analysis.
\item \strong{Annual Non-Outlier Rate}: For each indicator and each year, the function calculates the
percentage of non-outliers. Additionally, the function aggregates the non-outlier
rates across all indicators, as well as vaccination-only and tracer-only indicators,
providing an overall data quality summary.
