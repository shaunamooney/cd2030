\title{Calculate Percentage of Non-Missing Values by Year}
\usage{
calculate_completeness_summary(
  .data,
  admin_level = c("national", "adminlevel_1", "district"),
  include_year = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{cd_data} object containing indicator data, including columns with
the \code{mis_} prefix which represent missing value flags for each indicator.}

\item{admin_level}{Character. The administrative level at which to calculate
reporting rates. Must be one of \code{"national"}, \code{"adminlevel_1"} or \code{"district"}.}

\item{include_year}{Integer. Whether to include the year}
}
\value{
A \code{cd_completeness_summary} object containing a tibble. This tibble shows
the yearly percentages of non-missing values for each indicator and the average
percentage of non-missing values across all indicators per year.
}
\description{
\code{calculate_completeness_summary} computes the yearly percentage of non-missing
values across specified indicators, summarizing data completeness for each year.
Indicators with missing value flags are identified by a \code{mis_} prefix, representing
the completeness of various indicators for each year.
}
\details{
This function aggregates the percentage of non-missing values for each indicator
and calculates the overall average completeness across all indicators. This
provides a comprehensive view of data availability trends over time.

The function computes non-missing percentages as follows:
\itemize{
\item For each indicator, calculates the mean percentage of non-missing values by year.
\item Calculates additional summaries specifically for vaccination and tracer indicators.
\item Rounds results to two decimal places to maintain readability.
}

\dontrun{
  # Calculate the percentage of non-missing values by year for the data
  calculate_completeness_summary(data)
}
