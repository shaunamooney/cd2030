\title{Calculate District-Level Outliers Summary by Year}
\usage{
calculate_district_outlier_summary(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing district-level health indicator data. This data
frame must include precomputed outlier flags (columns ending in \verb{_outlier5std}),
where 1 represents an outlier and 0 represents non-outliers.}
}
\value{
A \code{cd_district_outliers_summary} object (tibble) with:
\itemize{
\item Each indicator's percentage of districts without extreme outliers, calculated yearly.
\item Aggregated summaries for non-outliers across all indicators, vaccination indicators,
and tracer indicators.
}
}
\description{
\code{calculate_district_outlier_summary} computes a district-level summary of extreme
outliers for specified health indicators. This function aggregates extreme outlier counts
for each indicator by first identifying the maximum outlier flag within each district
and year. An outlier is flagged based on Hampel's X84 method, where values exceeding
five Median Absolute Deviations (MAD) from the median are considered extreme outliers.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Outlier Aggregation}: The function first calculates the maximum outlier flag within
each district and year. This district-level flag is used to determine if extreme outliers
are present for each indicator.
\item \strong{Non-Outlier Percentage}: After aggregating by district and year, it computes the
mean percentage of districts without extreme outliers for each indicator, as well as
overall summaries for vaccination-only and tracer indicators.
\item \strong{Rounding}: Non-outlier percentages are rounded to two decimal places for clarity
in reporting and analysis.
