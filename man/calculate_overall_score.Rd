\title{Calculate Overall Quality Score for Data Quality Metrics}
\usage{
calculate_overall_score(
  .data,
  threshold,
  ratio_pairs = list(ratioAP = c("anc1", "penta1"), ratioPP = c("penta1", "penta3"))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame of type \code{cd_data} containing facility data
including annual reporting rates, completeness, and consistency indicators.}

\item{threshold}{The data reporting rate threshold.}

\item{ratio_pairs}{description}
}
\value{
A tibble with calculated scores for each metric, including
a summary row for the annual quality score. The result is ordered by
metric codes and ready for reporting in tabular or graphical form.
}
\description{
This function calculates an overall quality score based on various data
quality metrics. It summarizes completeness, outlier presence, and
consistency of reporting in immunization health facility data.
}
\details{
\code{calculate_overall_score} processes multiple data quality indicators:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Completeness metrics}: Percentage of expected reports, districts with
complete reporting, and districts with no missing values.
\item \strong{Outlier metrics}: Percentage of monthly values and districts without
extreme outliers.
\item \strong{Consistency ratios}: Ratios between different immunization indicators
to ensure internal consistency.
}

The function calculates averages for the selected metrics and includes
a row summarizing the annual data quality score.
