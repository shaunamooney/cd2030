)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{cd_coverage} data frame with combined immunization coverage data.}

\item{indicator}{Coverage indicators to include (e.g., \code{"penta3"}, \code{"measles1"}).}

\item{denominator}{Denominator sources for coverage calculations (e.g., \code{"dhis2"}).}

\item{region}{(Optional) Region for subnational filtering (e.g., \code{"Central Province"}).
Required for subnational analyses.}
}
\value{
A reshaped data frame with filtered indicators and denominators.
}
\description{
\code{filter_coverage} extracts specific coverage indicators and denominators from a
combined coverage dataset, applies regional filtering, and reshapes the data
for analysis and visualisation.
