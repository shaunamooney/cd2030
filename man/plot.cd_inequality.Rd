\usage{
\method{plot}{cd_inequality}(
  x,
  indicator,
  denominator = c("dhis2", "anc1", "penta1", "penta1derived"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{cd_inequality} object returned by \code{\link[=calculate_inequality]{calculate_inequality()}}.}

\item{indicator}{Character. Indicator to plot}

\item{denominator}{Character. The denominator to use}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the plotting function.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object displaying the subnational health coverage plot.
}
\description{
Generates a plot to visualize health coverage data across subnational units,
distinguishing between the national mean and subnational coverage. The Mean
Absolute Difference to the Mean (MADM) is displayed as an indicator on the
y-axis. Titles, subtitles, and labels dynamically adjust based on the chosen
indicator, denominator, and level.
