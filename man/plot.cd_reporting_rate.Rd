\title{Plot Reporting Rates for Subnational Units}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cd_reporting_rate}(
  x,
  plot_type = c("heat_map", "bar"),
  indicator = c("anc_rr", "idelv_rr", "vacc_rr"),
  threshold = 90,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{cd_reporting_rate} object. This should be the output of a reporting rate
calculation function containing subnational reporting rate data.}

\item{plot_type}{A character string specifying the plot type. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"heat_map"}: Creates a tile map of reporting rates across years and units.
\item \code{"bar"}: Creates bar plots faceted by region/district showing year-wise trends.
}}

\item{indicator}{A character. The indicator to visualize. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"anc_rr"}: Reporting rate for antenatal care visits
\item \code{"idelv_rr"}: Reporting rate for institutional deliveries
\item \code{"vacc_rr"}: Reporting rate for vaccination services
}}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. The threshold for categorizing high, medium, and low reporting
(default = 90). Used in \code{heat_map} mode only.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to internal methods (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
This S3 method visualizes reporting rates for ANC, delivery, or vaccination indicators
at subnational administrative levels using either heat maps or bar plots.
}
\details{
The plot adapts based on:
\itemize{
\item \code{plot_type = "heat_map"}:
\itemize{
\item Classifies reporting rates into three bands:
\itemize{
\item Red: \verb{< 70}
\item Orange: \verb{>= 70 & < threshold}
\item Green: \verb{>= threshold}
}
\item Labels are overlaid on each tile.
}
\item \code{plot_type = "bar"}:
\itemize{
\item Displays reporting rates as filled bars, faceted by district or adminlevel_1.
\item Colors are scaled using a gradient from red to green.
}
}

This function only supports subnational data. National-level objects will trigger an error.

  # Example: Plot heat map of vaccination reporting rates
  plot(cd_reporting_rate_obj, plot_type = "heat_map", indicator = "vacc_rr")

  # Example: Plot bar charts for institutional delivery reporting
  plot(cd_reporting_rate_obj, plot_type = "bar", indicator = "idelv_rr")
