## 1. Health Facility Data Quality Assessment {-}

### Background

Routinely reported health facility data are an important data source for health
indicators. The data are reported by health facilities on events such as immunizations
given, or live births attended. As with any data, quality is an issue. Data are checked
to consider completeness of reporting by health facilities, identify extreme outliers
and internal consistency. 

### Data Quality Sumary Table

```{r}

years <- unique(data$year)

data %>%
          calculate_overall_score(threshold) %>%
          mutate(
            type = case_when(

              no %in% c("2a", "2b") ~ '2. Extreme outliers (Common Vaccine antigens)',
              no %in% c("3a", "3b",'3f', '3g') ~ '3. Consistency of annual reporting'
            )

ratio, which should ideally be close to 1.

## 2. Health Facility Data Adjustments {-}

### Background

Completeness of reporting affects analysis, especially if it is low or varies between 
years. Extreme outliers can have a large impact, especially on subnational numbers.
Several steps are necessary to obtain a clean data set for “endline” analysis, 
including adjusting for incomplete reporting and correcting for extreme outliers. 
These graphs show the impact on the numbers.

```{r}
adjustments <- data %>%
  generate_adjustment_values(adjustment = 'custom', k_factors = !!k_factors)
```

### Health facility data adjustment: Numerators - reported live births

```{r}
plot(adjustments,
     indicator = 'ideliv',

## 3. Health facility data denominator assessment: DHIS2, UN Population and livebirths projections {-}

### Background

Service coverage is defined as the population who received the service divided by 
the population who need the services: the denominator. The quality of the population 
projections in DHIS2 is assessed through consistency over time and comparison with 
the UN projections.

### Vaccination Utilization level (Pentavalent 1 – Measles 1 dropout rates)

Monitoring the coverage of interventions is a critical and direct output of health 
systems. There is a very long interval in the EPI schedule between an infant receiving 
the first pentavalent immunization and completing the ‘fully immunized’ schedule with 
the first dose of measles vaccine. It is very important to complete all the 
immunizations to protect children from all the EPI target diseases.

Monitoring intervention coverage is a crucial output of health systems, especially

it is essential to utilize both health facility data and survey data.

## 7. Equity Analysis {-}

### Background 

Household surveys provide critical information on inequalities. The focus is on 
two major dimensions of inequality: household wealth quintile and education of 
the mother. Equiplots are used to assess whether the country has made progress 
since 2010 in reducing the poor rich gap or the gap between women with no education 
or low education and women with higher education.
