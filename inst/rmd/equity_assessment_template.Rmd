## 7. Equity Analysis {-}

### Background 

Household surveys provide critical information on inequalities. The focus is on 
two major dimensions of inequality: household wealth quintile and education of 
the mother. Equiplots are used to assess whether the country has made progress 
since 2010 in reducing the poor rich gap or the gap between women with no education 
or low education and women with higher education.


### Pentavalent 3 coverage by household wealth status

```{r, fig.cap='Fig 4g: Pentavalent 3 coverage by wealth, recent surveys'}
equiplot_wealth(wiq, 'penta3') +
