## 2. Health Facility Data Adjustments {-}

### Background

Completeness of reporting affects analysis, especially if it is low or varies between 
years. Extreme outliers can have a large impact, especially on subnational numbers.
Several steps are necessary to obtain a clean data set for “endline” analysis, 
including adjusting for incomplete reporting and correcting for extreme outliers. 
These graphs show the impact on the numbers.

```{r}
adjustments <- data %>%
  generate_adjustment_values(adjustment = 'custom', k_factors = !!k_factors)
```

### Health facility data adjustment: Numerators - reported live births

```{r}
plot(adjustments,
     indicator = 'ideliv',
     title = 'Figure 1c: Comparison of number of live births before and after adjustments for completness and outliers') +
  cd_report_theme()
```

```{r, results='asis'}
print_notes(cache, 'adjustment_changes', 'Live Births')
