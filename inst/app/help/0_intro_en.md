### Overview

The **Countdown to 2030 for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (CD2030)** initiative - implemented in collaboration with the **Global Financing Facility (GFF)**, **UNICEF**, **WHO**, **WAHO**, and other partners - aims to strengthen country-led progress and performance reviews.

These reviews include critical processes such as annual health sector reviews and midterm assessments of investment cases. As part of this CD2030 initiative, there is the **Immunization Coverage and Inequalities** Project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Immunization Coverage and Inequalities Project

The **Immunization Coverage and Inequalities** Project focuses on enhancing **evidence generation** and **analytical capacity** to **monitor immunisation coverage** and address inequalities across 26 sub-Saharan African countries.

The project contributes to improved data use for policy and programming in support of the **2030 Global Immunization Agenda** and the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

**Key Objectives**

-   To support country analysts to develop a set of national and subnational estimates for key routine immunization indicators using various health data sources.
-   To strengthen the skills of the country teams in the analysis of the routine health facility data (national and subnational) as well as the household survey data.
-   Enrich country-led monitoring of progress by supporting the development and implementation of comparable methods to estimate coverage from health facility data and other sources.
-   To synthesize and interpret all results from DHS, and HMIS analysis, and make strategic recommendations using the results.
-   Harness the use of digital tools in generation of evidence for decision-making and policy advocacy.

### cd2030 R Package

To support this work, CD2030 has developed the ***cd2030*** R package to promote the accessibility and usability of immunization data. The **cd2030** R package is a digital solution (developed in R environment) designed to streamline the analysis and reporting of immunization data.

The package is a central tool for immunization program managers, analysts and public health professionals offering the following features:

-   A **user-friendly interface** to manage, analyse and investigate immunization coverage and inequalities.
-   Functions and tools for **data manipulation**, **visualization**, and **statistical analysis**.
-   An **automated report generation** feature that provides both summaries and detailed immunization coverage and inequalities reports for policy information.
-   A **repository of functions** that can be customized to meet the specific needs of different countries and regions.

Complementing the **cd2030** R package, are other tools and resources such as the **CD2030 DHIS2 API** (For authorized, direct data extraction from the DHIS2 platform).
